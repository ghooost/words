## Words trainer

KISS: 0 dependancies, vanilla JS only, works both from Web and locally.
Loads data from a shared Google sheet.

Feel free to take a sample one there:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jBgmXRnafIlAe4zAgZRAGdkBJw-ySHRfza5FPH4HNII/edit?usp=sharing

Do not forget to share your sheet for everybody (that's the options at the sheet's Share dialogue). It is reqired to load data from there avoiding boring Google authorization.

Use it, change it, remake it - if you wish.
